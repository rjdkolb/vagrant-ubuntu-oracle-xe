# Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu 12.04 using Vagrant
This project enables you to install Oracle 11g XE in a virtual machine running
Ubuntu 12.04, using [Vagrant] and [Puppet].

## Acknowledgements
This project was created based on the information in [Installing Oracle 11g R2 Express Edition on Ubuntu 64-bit] by Manish Raj, and the GitHub repository [vagrant-oracle-xe] by Stefan Glase. The former explains how to install Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu 12.04, without explicitly providing a Vagrant or provisioner configuration. The latter has the same purpose as this project but uses Ubuntu 11.10.

Richard Kolb fixed the issue where the Ubuntu could not see DNS (`config.vm.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]`)

## Requirements
* You need to have [Vagrant] installed.
* Install the vagrant VirtualBox GÃ¼st Additions `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
* The host machine probably needs at least 4 GB of RAM (I have only tested 8 GB of RAM).
* As Oracle 11g XE is only available for 64-bit machines at the moment, the host machine needs to have a 64-bit architecture.
* I have tested this project on a host machine running Ubuntu 12.04, but other operating systems should also work, as long as they can run Vagrant.

## Installation
* Check out this project:

        git clone https://github.com/rjdkolb/vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe.git

* Download [Oracle Database 11g Express Edition] for Linux x64. Place the file `oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip` in the directory `modules/oracle/files` of this project.
* Run `vagrant up` from the base directory of this project. This should take a few minutes.

You should now be able to connect to the new database at `localhost:1521/xe` as `system` with password `manager`. For example, if you have `sqlplus` installed on the _host machine_ you can connect to the database with

    sqlplus system/manager@//localhost:1521/xe

or in the virtual machine with

    sqlplus system/manager@xe

The web frontend (APEX) can be reached on the _host machine_ on port 8081: http://127.0.0.1:8081/apex/f?p=4950

## Troubleshooting
It is important to assign enough memory to the virtual machine, otherwise you will get an error

    ORA-00845: MEMORY_TARGET not supported on this system

during the configuration stage. In the `Vagrantfile` 3084 MB is assigned. Lower values may also work, as long as (I believe) 2 GB are available for Oracle XE.
